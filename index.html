            Welcome to my blog.
        </p>
        <p class="info__content">
            Let's talk about a little about me. As you see, I'm frontend developer, I really
            love to design and create digital products.
            I'm always learning something new because that's what life is, <b>a bunch of stuff
            that needs to be learnt.</b>
        </p>
        <p class="info__content"> If you need some inspiration to begin, I would like to share some of my story.</p>
        <p class="info__content">I graduated from school 5 years ago as Computer Systems Engineer, I thought that I knew
            enough to go and eat the world, but unfortunately I was completly wrong. </p>
        <p class="info__content">I started to work in a big company as mid senior developer, (I was the only developer in the department)
            so that's why I was mid üòÇ, I started two cool projects, one of them was for home automation
            and I learnt how to work with Electrical Engineers, Raspberry PI and Python, and wow! that was tough.
        </p>
        <p class="info__content">
            Even when the projects were very interesting I didn't feel complete, I wanted to do more, 
            so I accepted an opportunity in other project, lots of nights working in the office, of course
            that was not for me, so I quit! 
        </p>
        <p class="info__content">Then I thought that I was found<b> my dream job</b>, my folks were super cool, always helping
            and working, this job was near of my home, I had free transportation and other good perks.
            And then ... something happened and everything became a toxic environment.
        </p>
        <p class="info__content"><b>Brace yourself because this is where the story begins üëÄ</b></p>
        <p class="info__content">I was very uncomfortable with everything, I didn't talk with nobody, I ate alone. üò¨
        </p>
        <p class="info__content">
            I started to search a new job, I was feeling very secure about my knowledge, so I applied
            to a great companies, but guess what?!, I was truly kicked in all of the interviews!. 
        </p>
        <p class="info__content">
            Wow that was the most painful feeling in my life.
            
        </p>
        <p class="info__content">
            Sometimes you can feel that way too, but you have two options: <br>
            1. Give up <br>
            2. Start learning
        </p>
        <p class="info__content">At this point I met <a class="info__link" href="https://platzi.com/" target="_blank">Platzi</a> and I didn't hesitate about purchase my suscription
        because my biggest desire is to become into a great frontend developer. </p>
        <p class="info__content">
            While I was studying in platzi I couldn't quit to my job because I needed the money so 
            I asked my boss if there was the possibility of being part of another team, and she accepted.
            The scrum master quit when I just joined the project, was very very tough at the beginning,
            and then they asked me if I wanted to be the scrum master, and I accepted. My team didn't want me in that position and
            was really tough to have their acceptance. 
        </p>
       
        <p class="info__content">
            I started to learn about emotional intelligence, time management, scrum, productivity, how to work with teams and so much more,
            that opened my mind in a very wonderful ways, I wanted to apply all that knowledge with my team but it wasn't possible because
            I was not accepted as her leader. 
            
        <p class="info__content">I never gave up though.</p>
        </p>
        <p class="info__content" >On April 2021 I was accepted as Platzi Master Student üíö and a new job opportunity came and I could quit to that job.</p>
        <p class="info__content">Right now I'm still learning in Platzi all about Javascript and Product design.</p>
        <p class="info__content">Finally I want you to remember this 3 things</p>
        <p class="info__content">ü§ó 1. Never give up on your dreams</p>
        <p class="info__content">ü§ó 2. Learn as much as you can</p>
        <p class="info__content">ü§ó 3. Share your knowledge</p>

        <p class="info__content">This is a plus one: <b>learn English.</b></p>

        <p class="info__content-green">
            But those who wait on the Lord
            Shall renew their strength;
            They shall mount up with wings like eagles,
            They shall run and not be weary,
            They shall walk and not faint.
            Isaiah 40:31
